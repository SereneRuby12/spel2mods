## Info
Modlunky hasn't support for scripts yet, so you have to use Overlunky.
## Instructions
- Download from https://github.com/estebanfer/Bumblebee-mod/releases
- Move bumblebee_mount.png and bumblebee.lua to overlunky/scripts folder
- Enable the script from Overlunky
- Spawn bumblebee with the buttons (bumblebees don't spawn naturally yet)
- If the game crashes when enabling the mod, update Overlunky WHIP version, the mod uses a feature that was added some days ago
## Notes
old_turkey_texture_change folder has the previously used way to change turkey textures to bumblebee.
