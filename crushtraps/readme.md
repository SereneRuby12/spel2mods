## :information_source: Mod details
Crush traps now spawn anywhere, replacing floor tiles.
There are 'safe zones', where crush blocks don't spawn, those zones can be useful for planning next move. You can configure the amount and radius. Safe zones can be easily recognized if using 100% spawn chance.
## :satellite: Online
Make sure everyone playing has the same settings, if not, there will be a desync. You can use the export button and copy the text to share your settings, then the other players paste it into the import text field and press the button to import. Settings are autosaved and autoloaded, so if you want to play with the default, press the default setting preset button just in case.

## :joystick: Good mods to play with
##### [SUPER HOT LUNKY](https://spelunky.fyi/mods/m/super-hot) by @Mr_Auto 
The game pauses when not moving, giving you time to think what to do.
##### [Slower Crush Traps](https://spelunky.fyi/mods/m/slower-crush-traps) by @Charade 
Crush traps move slower, giving you more reaction time
##### [SlowMo](https://spelunky.fyi/mods/m/slowmo) by me ( @estebanfer )
You can toggle slowmo to make it easier.
(Probably SUPER HOT LUNKY and SlowMo aren't compatible, I didn't test it tho)
##### [Extra Shortcuts](https://spelunky.fyi/mods/m/extra-shortcuts) by @garebear
Useful to play the mod on other places than dwelling.
